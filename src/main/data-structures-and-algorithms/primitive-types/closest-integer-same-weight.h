/*
 * Define the weight of a nonnegative integer x to be the number of bits that
 * are set to 1 in its binary representation. For example, since 92 in base-2
 * equals 0b1011100, the weight of 92 is 4.
 *
 * Write a program which takes an input a nonnegative integer x and returns a
 * number y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their
 * difference, |y - x|, is as small as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or
 * all 1s. For example, if x 6, you should return 5.
 *
 * Hint: Start with the least significant bit.
